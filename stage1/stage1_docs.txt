In this stage, we take the following important steps:

1. Open and read the corpus from the provided file corpus.txt. The filename is specified as user input. 
2. Break the corpus into individual words. 
   To create a Markov model, we use the simplest form of tokenization: 
      Tokens are separated by whitespace characters such as spaces, tabulation, and newline characters. 
      Punctuation marks should be left untouched since later on, they will play an important role in signaling where a sentence should end.
3. Acquire and print the following information about the corpus under the section of the output called Corpus statistics:
      — the number of all tokens;
      — the number of all unique tokens, that is, the number of tokens without repetition.
4. Take an integer as user input and print the token with the corresponding index. 
   Repeat this process until the string exit is input. 
   Also, we make sure that the input index is actually an integer that falls in the range of the corpus. 
   If that is not the case, print an error message and request a new input. Error messages should contain the types of errors (Type Error, Index Error, etc.).
